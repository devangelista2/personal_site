I"_<p>While working with data, it is common to have access to very high-dimensional unstructured informations (e.g. images, sounds, â€¦). To work with them, it is necessary to find a way to project them into a low-dimensional space where data which is semantically similar is close. This approach is called <strong>dimensionality reduction</strong>.</p>
